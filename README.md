# Pixel Art Fighting Game

This is a 2-player desktop game. The point of the game is to reduce your opponent's life bar down to 0 first to win the game. If time expires before either player dies, then the player with the higher health bar wins the game.

This web game is the 2nd game I've coded and I decided to make it using HTML, HTML Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript because those are the languages I am most familiar with.

## To play

### Player uses the following controls:
- `a` - left movement
- `d` - right movement
- `w` - jump
- `space bar` - attack

### Enemy uses the following controls:
- `left arrow` - left movement
- `right arrow` - right movement
- `up arrow` - jump
- `down arrow` - attack

For the most part, I followed the tutorial made by Chris Courses on YouTube, but I found that I did not want to use some of the techniques used to code during that tutorial and decided to code/structure things just a bit differently for my own personal taste.
